A pure numpy-based convolutional neural network (CNN) implementation for classifying the Fashion-MNIST dataset, without using any deep learning frameworks. This project demonstrates the core principles of CNNs, including convolution, pooling, batch normalization, and backpropagation.


## üìã Project Overview
Fashion-MNIST is a popular dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of 10 fashion categories. This project implements a LeNet-inspired CNN from scratch using only NumPy, achieving ~86% test accuracy after 5000 training steps.


## üîç Key Features
- **Framework-Free**: Entirely built with NumPy, no TensorFlow/PyTorch or other ML frameworks.
- **Complete Pipeline**: Includes data loading, model implementation, training, prediction, and visualization.
- **Core CNN Components**: Implements Conv2D, BatchNorm, ReLU, MaxPool2D and FullyConnected layers.
- **Training Utilities**: Logging, model saving/loading, and performance visualization.


## üß± Model Architecture (LeNet Variant)
The model follows a modified LeNet architecture with batch normalization for better performance:

## üöÄ Usage

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn prettytable
```

### Training
Run the training script to train the model from scratch:
```bash
python train.py
```
- Trained models are saved in the `models/` directory every 1000 steps.
- Training logs (loss, accuracy) are saved in the `logs/` directory.


### Prediction & Evaluation
Run the prediction script to evaluate trained models on test data:
```bash
python predict.py
```
- Generates confusion matrices and prints test accuracy for each saved model.


### Visualization
Plot training loss and accuracy curves using:
```bash
python plot.py
```
